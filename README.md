# University-Projects
Chess project in progress for 1st semester of university, currently in development, plans to include a website or GUI to further enhance the playablity.
Further plans to create a chess engine and create some difficulty levels.

Has to be played on linux, windows doesn't support ANSI escape sequences for colours <br>
Enjoy! <br>
